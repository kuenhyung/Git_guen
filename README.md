In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)<br>
or [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and other open source softwares.

for exmple, object in the following image were detected using [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection):
